Organization and Basis of Presentation\nThe fiscal year for Cisco Systems, Inc. (the \u201cCompany,\u201d \u201cCisco,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d or \u201cour\u201d) is the 52 or 53 weeks ending on the last Saturday in July. Fiscal 2024\nand fiscal 2023 are each 52-week fiscal years. The Consolidated Financial Statements include our accounts and those of our subsidiaries. All intercompany\naccounts and transactions have been eliminated. We conduct business globally and are primarily managed on a geographic basis in the following three\ngeographic segments: the Americas; Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA); and Asia Pacific, Japan, and China (APJC).\nWe have prepared the accompanying financial data as of April 27, 2024 and for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2024 and 2023, without audit,\npursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included\nin financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) have been condensed or omitted\npursuant to such rules and regulations. The July 29, 2023 Consolidated Balance Sheet was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all\ndisclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. However, we believe that the disclosures are adequate to make the\ninformation presented not misleading. These Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and\nthe notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 29, 2023.\nIn the opinion of management, all normal recurring adjustments necessary to state fairly the consolidated balance sheet as of April 27, 2024, the results of\noperations, the statements of comprehensive income and the statements of equity for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2024 and 2023, and the\nstatements of cash flows for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 and 2023, as applicable, have been made. The results of operations for the third quarter and\nfirst nine months of fiscal 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full fiscal year or any future periods.\nOur consolidated financial statements include our accounts and investments consolidated under the voting interest model. The noncontrolling interests\nattributed to these investments are not presented as a separate component in the equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets as these amounts are not\nmaterial for any of the fiscal periods presented. The share of earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interests are not presented separately in the\nConsolidated Statements of Operations as these amounts are not material for any of the fiscal periods presented.\nCertain reclassifications have been made to the amounts in prior periods in order to conform to the current period\u2019s presentation. We have evaluated subsequent\nevents through the date that the financial statements were issued.\n2. Recent Accounting Pronouncements\n(a) Recent Accounting Standards or Updates Not Yet Effective\nSegment Reporting In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an accounting standard update that expands the disclosure\nrequirements for reportable segments, primarily through enhanced disclosures around significant segment expenses. The accounting standard update will be\neffective for our fiscal 2025 Form 10-K on a retrospective basis, and early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this accounting\nstandard update on our segment disclosures.\nImprovements on Income Tax Disclosures In December 2023, the FASB issued an accounting standard update expanding the requirements for disclosure of\ndisaggregated information about the effective tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. The accounting standard update will be effective for our fiscal 2026\nForm 10-K. We are currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on our income tax disclosures.\n9\nTable of Contents\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Unaudited)\n3. Revenue\nWe enter into contracts with customers that can include various combinations of products and services which are generally distinct and accounted for as\nseparate performance obligations. As a result, our contracts may contain multiple performance obligations. We determine whether arrangements are distinct\nbased on whether the customer can benefit from the product or service on its own or together with other resources that are readily available and whether our\ncommitment to transfer the product or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other obligations in the contract. We classify our hardware,\nperpetual software licenses, and software-as-a-service (SaaS) as distinct performance obligations. Term software licenses represent multiple obligations, which\ninclude software licenses and software maintenance. In transactions where we deliver hardware or software, we are typically the principal and we record\nrevenue and costs of goods sold on a gross basis. We refer to our term software licenses, security software licenses, SaaS, and associated service arrangements\nas subscription offers.\nWe recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised goods or services in a contract with a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration we\nexpect to receive in exchange for those products or services. Transfer of control occurs once the customer has the contractual right to use the product, generally\nupon shipment, electronic delivery (or when the software is available for download by the customer), or once title and risk of loss has transferred to the\ncustomer. Transfer of control can also occur over time for software maintenance and services as the customer receives the benefit over the contract term. Our\nhardware and perpetual software licenses are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control. Term software\nlicenses include multiple performance obligations where the term licenses are recognized upfront upon transfer of control, with the associated software\nmaintenance revenue recognized ratably over the contract term as services and software updates are provided. SaaS arrangements do not include the right for\nthe customer to take possession of the software during the term, and therefore have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with\nrevenue recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer consumes the services. On our product sales, we record consideration from shipping and\nhandling on a gross basis within net product sales. We record our revenue net of any associated sales taxes.\nAn allowance for future sales returns is established based on historical trends in product return rates. The allowance for future sales returns as of April 27, 2024\nand July 29, 2023 was $35 million and $39 million, respectively, and was recorded as a reduction of our accounts receivable and revenue.\nSignificant Judgments\nRevenue is allocated among these performance obligations in a manner that reflects the consideration that we expect to be entitled to for the promised goods or\nservices based on standalone selling prices (SSP). SSP is estimated for each distinct performance obligation and judgment may be required in their\ndetermination. The best evidence of SSP is the observable price of a product or service when we sell the goods separately in similar circumstances and to\nsimilar customers. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, we determine SSP using information that may include market conditions and other\nobservable inputs.\nWe assess relevant contractual terms in our customer contracts to determine the transaction price. We apply judgment in identifying contractual terms and\ndetermining the transaction price as we may be required to estimate variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Variable\nconsideration includes potential contractual penalties and various rebate, cooperative marketing and other incentive programs that we offer to our distributors,\nchannel partners and customers. When determining the amount of revenue to recognize, we estimate the expected usage of these programs, applying the\nexpected value or most likely estimate and update the estimate at each reporting period as actual utilization becomes available. We also consider the customers\u2019\nright of return in determining the transaction price, where applicable.\nWe assess certain software licenses, such as for security software, that contain critical updates or upgrades which customers can download throughout the\ncontract term. Without these updates or upgrades, the functionality of the software would diminish over a relatively short time period. These updates or\nupgrades provide the customer the full functionality of the purchased security software licenses and are required to maintain the security license\u2019s utility as the\nrisks and threats in the environment are rapidly changing. In these circumstances, the revenue from these software arrangements is recognized as a single\nperformance obligation satisfied over the contract term.\n10\nTable of Contents\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Unaudited)\n(a) Disaggregation of Revenue\nWe disaggregate our revenue into groups of similar products and services that depict the nature, amount, and timing of revenue and cash flows for our various\nofferings. The sales cycle, contractual obligations, customer requirements, and go-to-market strategies differ for each of our product categories, resulting in\ndifferent economic risk profiles for each category. Effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we began reporting our product and service revenue in the\nfollowing categories: Networking, Security, Collaboration, Observability, and Services and conformed our product revenue for prior periods to the current\nperiod presentation. The following table presents this disaggregation of revenue (in millions):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nApril 27, April 29, April 27, April 29,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nProduct revenue:\nNetworking $ 6,522 $ 8,982 $ 22,425 $ 25,105\nSecurity 1,304 958 3,288 2,872\nCollaboration 987 985 3,093 3,029\nObservability 211 167 589 486\nTotal Product 9,024 11,092 29,395 31,492\nServices 3,678 3,479 10,766 10,303\nTotal $ 12,702 $ 14,571 $ 40,161 $ 41,795\nAmounts may not sum due to rounding.\nNetworking consists of our core networking technologies of switching, routing, wireless, 5G, silicon, optics solutions and compute products. These\ntechnologies consist of both hardware and software offerings, including software licenses and SaaS. Our hardware and perpetual software in this category are\ndistinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control. Term software licenses are multiple performance obligations\nwhere the term license is recognized upfront upon transfer of control with the associated software maintenance revenue recognized ratably over the contract\nterm. SaaS arrangements in this category have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the\ncontract term.\nSecurity consists of our Cloud and Application Security, Industrial Security, Network Security, and User and Device Security offerings. This product category\nincludes the Splunk Platform and Splunk Security offerings after our acquisition of Splunk, although the Splunk Platform has use cases that can also be\napplicable for observability offerings. See Note 4. These products consist of both hardware and software offerings, including software licenses and SaaS.\nUpdates and upgrades for the term software licenses are critical for our software to perform its intended commercial purpose because of the continuous need\nfor our software to secure our customers\u2019 network environments against frequent threats. Therefore, security software licenses are generally represented by a\nsingle distinct performance obligation with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term. Our hardware and perpetual software in this category are distinct\nperformance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control. SaaS arrangements in this category have one distinct performance\nobligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term.\nCollaboration consists of our Meetings, Collaboration Devices, Calling, Contact Center and Communication Platform as a Service (CPaaS) offerings. These\nproducts consist primarily of software offerings, including software licenses and SaaS, as well as hardware. Our perpetual software and hardware in this\ncategory are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control. Term software licenses are multiple performance\nobligations where the term license is recognized upfront upon transfer of control with the associated software maintenance revenue recognized ratably over the\ncontract term. SaaS arrangements in this category have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over\nthe contract term.\nObservability consists of our full stack observability offerings. This product category includes the Splunk Observability Suite after our acquisition of Splunk.\nThis product category excludes the Splunk Platform which includes use cases that can also be associated with observability offerings. See Note 4. These\nproducts consist primarily of software offerings, including software licenses and SaaS. Our perpetual software in this category are distinct performance\nobligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control. Term software licenses are multiple performance obligations where the term license is\nrecognized upfront upon transfer of control with the associated software maintenance revenue recognized ratably over the contract term. SaaS arrangements in\nthis category have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term.\n11\nTable of Contents\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Unaudited)\nIn addition to our product offerings, we provide a broad range of service and support options for our customers, including technical support services and\nadvanced services. Technical support services represent the majority of these offerings which are distinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time\nwith revenue recognized ratably over the contract term. Advanced services are distinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time with revenue\nrecognized as services are delivered.\nThe sales arrangements as discussed above are typically made pursuant to customer purchase orders based on master purchase or partner agreements.

We incurred $49 million and $84 million of these costs in the third quarter and first nine\nmonths of fiscal 2024, respectively.\n13\nTable of Contents\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Unaudited)\nIn connection with the Splunk acquisition, we assumed $3.1 billion aggregate principal amount of notes consisting of Splunk's 1.125% Convertible Senior\nNotes due 2025, 0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 and 1.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2027 (collectively, the \u201cSplunk Convertible Notes\u201d). The\nSplunk Convertible Notes had an aggregate fair value of $3.3 billion as of the acquisition date. The Splunk Convertible Notes are convertible and may be\nsettled into cash based on a defined conversion ratio for each note. On the date of the acquisition, we notified holders of their right to convert their notes. In\naddition, we assumed Splunk\u2019s capped call contracts which were intended to reduce potential dilution or offset any cash payments. The capped calls were\nsettled in full in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, which resulted in receipt of aggregate cash proceeds of $202 million, and were included in other current assets\nin total purchase consideration noted above.

We recognized a net unrealized\ngain of $20 million and $40 million during the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2024, respectively, and a net unrealized loss of $2 million and\n$11 million during the corresponding periods of fiscal 2023, respectively, on our marketable securities still held as of the reporting date. Our net adjustments to\nnon-marketable equity securities measured using the measurement alternative still held was a net loss of $21 million and $155 million for the third quarter and\nfirst nine months of fiscal 2024, respectively, and a net gain of $7 million and a net loss of $2 million for the corresponding periods of fiscal 2023, respectively.\nWe held equity interests in certain private equity funds of $0.8 billion and $0.9 billion as of April 27, 2024 and July 29, 2023, respectively, which are accounted\nfor under the NAV practical expedient.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we have investments in privately held companies and provide financing to certain customers. These privately held\ncompanies and customers are evaluated for consolidation under the variable interest or voting interest entity models. We evaluate on an ongoing basis our\ninvestments in these privately held companies and our customer financings, and have determined that as of April 27, 2024, there were no additional significant\nvariable interest or voting interest entities required to be consolidated in our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe carrying value of our investments in privately held companies was $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion as of April 27, 2024 and July 29, 2023, respectively. Of the\ntotal carrying value of our investments in privately held companies as of April 27, 2024, $0.9 billion of such investments are considered to be in variable\ninterest entities which are unconsolidated. As of April 27, 2024, we have total funding commitments of $0.2 billion related to privately held investments. The\ncarrying value of these investments and the additional funding commitments, collectively, represent our maximum exposure related to privately held\ninvestments.\n26\nTable of Contents\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Unaudited)\n11.

Level 2 available-for-sale debt investments are\npriced using quoted market prices for similar instruments or nonbinding market prices that are corroborated by observable market data. We use inputs such as\nactual trade data, benchmark yields, broker/dealer quotes, and other similar data, which are obtained from quoted market prices, independent pricing vendors,\nor other sources, to determine the ultimate fair value of these assets and liabilities. We use such pricing data as the primary input to make our assessments and\ndeterminations as to the ultimate valuation of our investment portfolio and have not made, during the periods presented, any material adjustments to such\ninputs. We are ultimately responsible for the financial statements and underlying estimates. Our derivative instruments are primarily classified as Level 2, as\nthey are not actively traded and are valued using pricing models that use observable market inputs. We did not have any transfers between Level 1 and Level 2\nfair value measurements during the periods presented.\n27\nTable of Contents\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Unaudited)\n(b) Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis\nOur non-marketable equity securities using the measurement alternative are adjusted to fair value on a non-recurring basis. Adjustments are made when\nobservable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer occur, or due to impairment. These securities are classified as Level 3 in the fair\nvalue hierarchy because we estimate the value based on valuation methods using the observable transaction price at the transaction date and other unobservable\ninputs such as volatility, rights, and obligations of the securities we hold.\nThe fair value for purchased intangible assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis was categorized as Level 3 due to the use of significant\nunobservable inputs in the valuation. Significant unobservable inputs that were used included expected revenues and net income related to the assets and the\nexpected life of the assets. The difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the assets was recorded as an impairment charge, which\nwas included in product cost of sales and operating expenses as applicable. See Note 5.\n(c) Other Fair Value Disclosures\nThe fair value of our short-term loan receivables approximates their carrying value due to their short duration. The aggregate carrying value of our long-term\nloan receivables as of April 27, 2024 and July 29, 2023 was $2.6 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively. The estimated fair value of our long-term loan\nreceivables approximates their carrying value. We use unobservable inputs in determining discounted cash flows to estimate the fair value of our long-term\nloan receivables, and therefore they are categorized as Level 3.\nAs of April 27, 2024, the estimated fair value of our short-term debt approximates its carrying value due to the short maturities. As of April 27, 2024, the fair\nvalue of our senior notes was $20.0 billion with a carrying amount of $20.1 billion. This compares to a fair value of $8.7 billion and a carrying amount of $8.4\nbillion as of July 29, 2023. The fair value of the senior notes was determined based on observable market prices in a less active market and was categorized as\nLevel 2.\n12.

These swaps convert the fixed interest rates of the fixed-rate notes to floating interest rates based on Secured Overnight Financing Rate\n(SOFR). The gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps substantially offset changes in the fair value of the hedged portion of\nthe underlying debt that are attributable to the changes in market interest rates. For additional information, see Note 13.\nInterest is payable semiannually on each class of the senior fixed-rate notes. Each of the senior fixed-rate notes is redeemable by us at any time, subject to a\nmake-whole premium.

On February 2, 2024, we entered\ninto an amended and restated 5-year $5.0 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement. The interest rate for the credit agreement is determined based on a\nformula using certain market rates. The credit agreement requires that we comply with certain covenants, including that we maintain an interest coverage ratio\n(defined in the agreement as the ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense) of not less than 3.0 to 1.0. As of April 27, 2024, we were in\ncompliance with all associated covenants and we had not borrowed any funds under our credit agreement.\n13. Derivative Instruments\n(a) Summary of Derivative Instruments\nWe use derivative instruments primarily to manage exposures to foreign currency exchange rate, interest rate, and equity price risks. Our primary objective in\nholding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity\nprices. Our derivatives expose us to credit risk to the extent that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreement. We seek to mitigate such\nrisks by limiting our counterparties to major financial institutions and requiring collateral in certain cases. In addition, the potential risk of loss with any one\ncounterparty resulting from credit risk is monitored. Management does not expect material losses as a result of defaults by counterparties.\nThe fair values of our derivative instruments and the line items on the Consolidated Balance Sheets to which they were recorded are summarized as follows (in\nmillions):\nDERIVATIVE ASSETS DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES\nApril 27, July 29, April 27, July 29,\nBalance Sheet Line Item 2024 2023 Balance Sheet Line Item 2024 2023\nDerivatives designated as hedging\ninstruments:\nForeign currency derivatives Other current assets $ 45 $ 22 Other current liabilities $ 1 $ \u2014\nForeign currency derivatives Other assets 19 9 Other long-term liabilities \u2014 \u2014\nInterest rate derivatives Other current assets \u2014 \u2014 Other current liabilities \u2014 17\nInterest rate derivatives Other assets \u2014 \u2014 Other long-term liabilities 16 24\nTotal 64 31 17 41\nDerivatives not designated as hedging\ninstruments:\nForeign currency derivatives Other current assets 2 1 Other current liabilities 47 25\nForeign currency derivatives Other assets \u2014 \u2014 Other long-term liabilities 20 9\nTotal 2 1 67 34\nTotal $ 66 $ 32 $ 84 $ 75\n30\nTable of Contents\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Unaudited)\nThe following amounts were recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets related to cumulative basis adjustments for our fair value hedges (in millions):\nCUMULATIVE AMOUNT OF FAIR\nVALUE HEDGING ADJUSTMENT\nINCLUDED IN THE CARRYING\nCARRYING AMOUNT OF THE HEDGED AMOUNT OF THE HEDGED\nASSETS/(LIABILITIES) ASSETS/LIABILITIES\nApril 27, July 29, April 27, July 29,\nBalance Sheet Line Item of Hedged Item 2024 2023 2024 2023\nShort-term debt $ \u2014 $ (983) $ \u2014 $ 17\nLong-term debt $ (484) $ (476) $ 16 $ 24\nThe effect of derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, recognized in interest and other income (loss), net is summarized as follows (in millions):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nApril 27, 2024 April 29, 2023 April 27, 2024 April 29, 2023\nInterest rate derivatives:\nHedged items $ (2) $ (6) $ (25) $ 26\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments 2 6 25 (26)\nTotal $ \u2014 $ \u2014 $ \u2014 $ \u2014\nThe effect on the Consolidated Statements of Operations of derivative instruments not designated as hedges is summarized as follows (in millions):\nGAINS (LOSSES) FOR THE THREE GAINS (LOSSES) FOR THE NINE\nMONTHS ENDED MONTHS ENDED\nDerivatives Not Designated as Line Item in Statements of April 27, April 29, April 27, April 29,\nHedging Instruments Operations 2024 2023 2024 2023\nForeign currency derivatives Other income (loss), net $ (84) $ (46) $ (161) $ 22\nTotal return swaps\u2014deferred compensation Operating expenses and other 16 (12) 33 7\nEquity derivatives Other income (loss), net \u2014 4 1 8\nTotal $ (68) $ (54) $ (127) $ 37\nThe notional amounts of our outstanding derivatives are summarized as follows (in millions):\nApril 27, July 29,\n2024 2023\nForeign currency derivatives $ 7,077 $ 5,419\nInterest rate derivatives 500 1,500\nTotal return swaps\u2014deferred compensation 915 792\nTotal $ 8,492 $ 7,711\n(b) Offsetting of Derivative Instruments\nWe present our derivative instruments at gross fair values in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. However, our master netting and other similar arrangements with\nthe respective counterparties allow for net settlement under certain conditions, which are designed to reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement with the\nsame counterparty.\nTo further limit credit risk, we also enter into collateral security arrangements related to certain derivative instruments whereby cash is posted as collateral\nbetween the counterparties based on the fair market value of the derivative instrument. Under these collateral security arrangements, the net cash collateral\nprovided for was $16 million and $40 million as of April 27, 2024 and July 29, 2023, respectively.\n31\nTable of Contents\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Unaudited)\n(c) Foreign Currency Exchange Risk\nWe conduct business globally in numerous currencies. Therefore, we are exposed to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. To limit the\nexposure related to foreign currency changes, we enter into foreign currency contracts. We do not enter into such contracts for speculative purposes.\nWe hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions related to certain revenues, operating expenses and service cost of sales with currency options and forward\ncontracts. These currency options and forward contracts, designated as cash flow hedges, generally have maturities of less than 24 months. The derivative\ninstrument\u2019s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and subsequently reclassified into earnings\nwhen the hedged exposure affects earnings.\nWe enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to reduce the short-term effects of foreign currency fluctuations on assets and liabilities such as\nforeign currency receivables, long-term customer financings and payables. These derivatives are not designated as hedging instruments. Gains and losses on the\ncontracts are included in other income (loss), net, and substantially offset foreign exchange gains and losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and\nliabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the reporting entity.\nWe hedge certain net investments in our foreign operations with forward contracts to reduce the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on our net investment\nin those foreign subsidiaries. These derivative instruments generally have maturities of up to six months.\n(d) Interest Rate Risk\nWe hold an interest rate swap designated as a fair value hedge related to a fixed-rate senior note that is due in fiscal 2025. Under the interest rate swap, we\nreceive fixed-rate interest payments and make interest payments based on SOFR plus a fixed number of basis points. The effect of the swap is to convert the\nfixed interest rate of the senior fixed-rate note to a floating interest rate based on SOFR. The gain and loss related to changes in the fair value of the interest rate\nswap is included in interest expense and substantially offset the change in the fair value of the hedged portion of the underlying debt attributable to the change\nin market interest rates.\n(e) Equity Price Risk\nWe hold marketable equity securities in our portfolio that are subject to price risk. To diversify our overall portfolio, we also hold equity derivatives that are not\ndesignated as accounting hedges. The change in the fair value of each of these investment types are included in other income (loss), net.\nWe are also exposed to variability in compensation charges related to certain deferred compensation obligations to employees and directors. Although not\ndesignated as accounting hedges, we utilize derivatives such as total return swaps to economically hedge this exposure and offset the related compensation\nexpense.\n14. Commitments and Contingencies\n(a) Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Suppliers\nWe purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the\nnormal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate component supply, we enter into agreements with contract\nmanufacturers and suppliers that allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or establish the parameters defining our requirements. A\nsignificant portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements consists of firm, noncancelable, and unconditional commitments.\nCertain of these inventory purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers relate to arrangements to secure supply and pricing for certain\nproduct components for multi-year periods. In certain instances, these agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based\non our business needs prior to firm orders being placed.\n32\nTable of Contents\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Unaudited)\nThe following table summarizes our inventory purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers by period (in millions):\nApril 27, July 29,\n2024 2023\nLess than 1 year $ 4,581 $ 5,270\n1 to 3 years 1,368 1,783\n3 to 5 years 55 200\nTotal $ 6,004 $ 7,253\nWe record a liability for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with\nthe valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory. As of April 27, 2024 and July 29, 2023, the liability for these purchase commitments was $550 million and\n$529 million, respectively, and was included in other current liabilities.\n(b) Other Commitments\nWe have certain funding commitments, primarily related to our privately held investments. The funding commitments were $0.2 billion and $0.3 billion as of\nApril 27, 2024 and July 29, 2023, respectively.\n(c) Product Warranties\nThe following table summarizes the activity related to the product warranty liability (in millions):\nNine Months Ended\nApril 27, April 29,\n2024 2023\nBalance at beginning of period $ 329 $ 333\nProvisions for warranties issued 316 285\nAdjustments for pre-existing warranties 20 15\nSettlements (302) (321)\nBalance at end of period $ 363 $ 312\nWe accrue for warranty costs as part of our cost of sales based on associated material product costs, labor costs for technical support staff, and associated\noverhead. Our products are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from 90 days to five years, and for some products we provide a limited lifetime\nwarranty.\n(d) Financing and Other Guarantees\nIn the ordinary course of business, we provide financing guarantees for various third-party financing arrangements extended to channel partners customers.\nPayments under these financing guarantee arrangements were not material for the periods presented.\nChannel Partner Financing Guarantees We facilitate arrangements for third-party financing extended to channel partners, consisting of revolving short-term\nfinancing, with payment terms generally ranging from 60 to 90 days. These financing arrangements facilitate the working capital requirements of the channel\npartners, and, in some cases, we guarantee a portion of these arrangements. The volume of channel partner financing was $6.1 billion and $8.3 billion for the\nthird quarter of fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $20.9 billion and $23.4 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively. The\nbalance of the channel partner financing subject to guarantees was $1.1 billion and $1.7 billion as of April 27, 2024 and July 29, 2023, respectively.\n33\nTable of Contents\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Unaudited)\nFinancing Guarantee Summary The aggregate amounts of channel partner financing guarantees outstanding at April 27, 2024 and July 29, 2023, representing\nthe total maximum potential future payments under financing arrangements with third parties along with the related deferred revenue, are summarized in the\nfollowing table (in millions):\nApril 27, July 29,\n2024 2023\nMaximum potential future payments $ 126 $ 159\nDeferred revenue (25) (34)\nTotal $ 101 $ 125\n(e) Indemnifications\nIn the normal course of business, we have indemnification obligations to other parties, including customers, lessors, and parties to other transactions with us,\nwith respect to certain matters. We have agreed to indemnify against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants or out of intellectual property\ninfringement or other claims made against certain parties. These agreements may limit the time or circumstances within which an indemnification claim can be\nmade and the amount of the claim.\nIt is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount for claims made under the indemnification obligations due to uncertainties in the litigation\nprocess, coordination with and contributions by other parties and the defendants in these types of cases, and the unique facts and circumstances involved in\neach particular case and agreement. Historically, indemnity payments made by us have not had a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our Amended and Restated Bylaws contain similar\nindemnification obligations to our agents.\n(f) Legal Proceedings\nBrazil Brazilian authorities have investigated our Brazilian subsidiary and certain of its former employees, as well as a Brazilian importer of our products, and\nits affiliates and employees, relating to alleged evasion of import taxes and alleged improper transactions involving the subsidiary and the importer. Brazilian\ntax authorities have assessed claims against our Brazilian subsidiary based on a theory of joint liability with the Brazilian importer for import taxes, interest,\nand penalties. In addition to claims asserted by the Brazilian federal tax authorities in prior fiscal years, tax authorities from the Brazilian state of Sao Paulo\nhave asserted similar claims on the same legal basis in prior fiscal years. The asserted claims by Brazilian federal tax authorities are for calendar years 2003\nthrough 2007, and the asserted claims by the tax authorities from the state of Sao Paulo are for calendar years 2005 through 2007. The total asserted claims by\nBrazilian state and federal tax authorities aggregate to $157 million for the alleged evasion of import and other taxes, $902 million for interest, and $357\nmillion for various penalties, all determined using an exchange rate as of April 27, 2024.\nWe have completed a thorough review of the matters and believe the asserted claims against our Brazilian subsidiary are without merit, and we are defending\nthe claims vigorously. While we believe there is no legal basis for the alleged liability, due to the complexities and uncertainty surrounding the judicial process\nin Brazil and the nature of the claims asserting joint liability with the importer, we are unable to determine the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome against our\nBrazilian subsidiary and are unable to reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any. We do not expect a final judicial determination for several years.\nCentripetal On February 13, 2018, Centripetal Networks, Inc. (\u201cCentripetal\u201d) asserted patent infringement claims against us in the U.S. District Court for the\nEastern District of Virginia, alleging that several of our products and services infringe eleven Centripetal U.S. patents. After two bench trials and various\nadministrative actions and appeals, we have been found either to not have infringed any of the patents or the patents have been invalidated. There is an appeal\nof one of the invalidity decisions and we expect a further appeal by Centripetal.\nBetween April 2020 and February 2022, Centripetal also filed complaints in the District Court of Dusseldorf in Germany (\u201cGerman Court\u201d), asserting a total of\nfive patents and one utility model. Centripetal sought damages and injunctive relief in all cases. In various proceedings in 2021, 2022, and 2023, we have been\nfound to have not infringed three patents, one patent was invalidated, the utility model was invalidated, and the infringement action on the final patent is stayed\ndue to a pending invalidity action, which has a hearing set for June 6, 2024. Centripetal\u2019s appeals of two of the non-infringement findings remain pending and,\non March 27, 2024, the Court of Appeals rejected Centripetal\u2019s appeal of the third non-infringement finding.\nOn July 10, 2023, Centripetal filed a complaint in the Paris Judiciary Court asserting the French counterpart of a European Patent. Centripetal seeks damages\nand injunctive relief in the case. Centripetal previously asserted the German counterpart of the same European Patent in Germany and the German Court\nrejected Centripetal\u2019s complaint finding no infringement. We\n34\nTable of Contents\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Unaudited)\nhave filed our response and defenses to the complaint and, on May 24, 2024, we expect the Paris Judiciary Court to decide our motion to dismiss and, if denied,\nit will set the schedule for the remainder of the proceedings.\nDue to uncertainty surrounding patent litigation processes in the U.S. and Europe, we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate outcome of the litigations\nat this time. If we do not prevail in these litigations, we believe that any damages ultimately assessed would not have a material effect on our Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\nRamot On June 12, 2019 and on February 26, 2021, Ramot at Tel Aviv University Ltd. (\u201cRamot\u201d) asserted patent infringement claims against Cisco and Acacia\nin the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas (\u201cE.D. Tex.\u201d) and in the District of Delaware (\u201cD. Del.\u201d), respectively. Ramot is seeking damages,\nincluding enhanced damages, and a royalty on future sales. Ramot alleges that certain optical transceiver modules and line cards infringe three patents. We\nchallenged the validity of the patents in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cPTO\u201d) and the pending District Court cases have been stayed. On September\n28, 2021 and May 24, 2022, Cisco and Acacia filed two declaratory judgment actions of noninfringement against Ramot in D. Del on other Ramot patents and\nthose proceedings are ongoing.\nWhile we believe that we have strong non-infringement and invalidity arguments in these litigations, and that Ramot\u2019s damages theories in such cases are not\nsupported by prevailing law, we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate outcome of these litigations at this time due to uncertainties in the litigation\nprocesses. If we do not prevail in court in these litigations, we believe any damages ultimately assessed would not have a material effect on our Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\nEgenera On August 8, 2016, Egenera, Inc. (\u201cEgenera\u201d) asserted infringement claims against us in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts,\nalleging that Cisco\u2019s Unified Computing System Manager infringes three patents. Egenera sought damages, including enhanced damages, and an injunction.\nTwo of the asserted patents were dismissed, leaving Egenera\u2019s infringement claim based on one asserted patent. On March 25, 2022, the PTO preliminarily\nfound all of the asserted claims of the remaining patent unpatentable in ex parte reexamination proceedings. On August 15, 2022, after a jury trial for the\nremaining patent, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Cisco. The District Court denied Egenera\u2019s post-trial motions, and Egenera filed an appeal to the\nFederal Circuit on January 13, 2023, the appeal is fully briefed and we are awaiting a hearing date from the Federal Circuit.\nViasat On November 6, 2019, Viasat, Inc. (\u201cViasat\u201d) filed suit against Acacia in the California Superior Court for San Diego County (\u201cSDSC\u201d), alleging\ncontract and trade secret claims for certain Acacia products sold from January 1, 2019 forward. On June 9, 2020, Viasat filed another suit in SDSC alleging\ncontract and trade secret claims for sales of additional Acacia products. Both matters have been formally dismissed and resolved during fiscal 2024 through a\nsettlement for an amount that did not have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn addition to the above matters, we are subject to other legal proceedings, claims, and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, including\nintellectual property litigation. While the outcome of these matters is currently not determinable, we do not believe that the ultimate costs to resolve these\nmatters will have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. For additional information regarding intellectual property litigation, see \u201cPart II,\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\u2014We may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others\u201d herein.\n35\nTable of Contents\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Unaudited)\n15. Stockholders\u2019 Equity\n(a) Stock Repurchase Program\nIn September 2001, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program. As of April 27, 2024, the remaining authorized amount for stock\nrepurchases under this program was approximately $7.2 billion with no termination date. The stock repurchase activity for fiscal 2024 and 2023 under the stock\nrepurchase program, reported based on the trade date, is summarized as follows (in millions, except per-share amounts):\nWeighted-Average Price\nQuarter Ended Shares per Share Amount\nFiscal 2024\nApril 27, 2024 26 $ 49.22 $ 1,256\nJanuary 27, 2024 25 $ 49.54 $ 1,254\nOctober 28, 2023 23 $ 54.53 $ 1,252\nFiscal 2023\nJuly 29, 2023 25 $ 50.49 $ 1,254\nApril 29, 2023 25 $ 49.45 $ 1,259\nJanuary 28, 2023 26 $ 47.72 $ 1,256\nOctober 29, 2022 12 $ 43.76 $ 502\nThere were stock repurchases of $38 million and $48 million that were pending settlement as of April 27, 2024 and July 29, 2023, respectively.\nThe purchase price for the shares of our stock repurchased is reflected as a reduction to stockholders\u2019 equity. We are required to allocate the purchase price of\nthe repurchased shares as (i) a reduction to retained earnings or an increase to accumulated deficit and (ii) a reduction of common stock and additional paid-in\ncapital.\n(b) Dividends Declared\nOn May 15, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per common share to be paid on July 24, 2024, to all stockholders of record as\nof the close of business on July 5, 2024. Future dividends will be subject to the approval of our Board of Directors.\n(c) Preferred Stock\nUnder the terms of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Board of Directors is authorized to issue preferred stock in one or more series\nand, in connection with the creation of such series, to fix by resolution the designation, powers (including voting powers (if any)), preferences and relative,\nparticipating, optional or other special rights, if any, of such series, and any qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, of the shares of such series. As of\nApril 27, 2024, we had not issued any shares of preferred stock.\n16. Employee Benefit Plans\n(a) Employee Stock Incentive Plans\nWe have one stock incentive plan: the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan (the \u201c2005 Plan\u201d). In addition, we have, in connection with our acquisitions of various\ncompanies, assumed the share-based awards granted under stock incentive plans of the acquired companies or issued share-based awards in replacement\nthereof. Share-based awards are designed to reward employees for their long-term contributions to us and provide incentives for them to remain with us. The\nnumber and frequency of share-based awards are based on competitive practices, our operating results, government regulations, and other factors. Our primary\nstock incentive plan is summarized as follows:\nThe 2005 Plan provides for the granting of stock options, stock grants, stock units and stock appreciation rights (SARs), the vesting of which may be time-\nbased or upon satisfaction of performance goals, or both, and/or other conditions. Employees (including employee directors and executive officers) and\nconsultants of Cisco and its subsidiaries and affiliates and non-employee directors of Cisco are eligible to participate in the 2005 Plan. The 2005 Plan may be\nterminated by our Board of Directors at any time and for any reason, and is currently set to terminate at the 2030 Annual Meeting unless re-adopted or extended\nby our stockholders prior to or on such date.\n36\nTable of Contents\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Unaudited)\nUnder the 2005 Plan\u2019s share reserve feature, a distinction is made between the number of shares in the reserve attributable to (i) stock options and SARs and\n(ii) \u201cfull value\u201d awards (i.e., stock grants and stock units). Shares issued as stock grants, pursuant to stock units or pursuant to the settlement of dividend\nequivalents are counted against shares available for issuance under the 2005 Plan on a 1.5-to-1 ratio. For each share awarded as restricted stock or a restricted\nstock unit award under the 2005 Plan, 1.5 shares was deducted from the available share-based award balance. If awards issued under the 2005 Plan are forfeited\nor terminated for any reason before being exercised or settled, then the shares underlying such awards, plus the number of additional shares, if any, that counted\nagainst shares available for issuance under the 2005 Plan at the time of grant as a result of the application of the share ratio described above, will become\navailable again for issuance under the 2005 Plan. As of April 27, 2024, 165 million shares were authorized for future grant under the 2005 Plan.\n(b) Employee Stock Purchase Plan\nWe have an Employee Stock Purchase Plan under which eligible employees are offered shares through a 24-month offering period, which consists of four\nconsecutive 6-month purchase periods. Employees may purchase a limited amount of shares of our stock at a discount of up to 15% of the lesser of the fair\nmarket value at the beginning of the offering period or the end of each 6-month purchase period. The Employee Stock Purchase Plan is scheduled to terminate\non the earlier of (i) January 3, 2030 and (ii) the date on which all shares available for issuance under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan are sold pursuant to\nexercised purchase rights. No shares were issued under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan during each of the third quarters of fiscal 2024 and 2023. As of\nApril 27, 2024, 78 million shares were available for issuance under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan.\n(c) Summary of Share-Based Compensation Expense\nShare-based compensation expense consists primarily of expenses for RSUs and stock purchase rights, granted to employees or assumed from acquisitions.
